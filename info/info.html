        <h2>Bagel Preperation</h2>
        <p>Our bagel, even after it has been cut in half, is sometimes too large for the conventional toaster. In this instance,
        the bagel must be compressed after cutting in order to fit into the toaster slots.</p>
        
        <p>The bagel will make anything taste better. Consider using it in the construction of your next sandwich. A traditional
        favorite is composed of lox (smoked salmon) and cream cheese strategically placed between the two halves of a sliced
        bagel with a slice of tomato and onion to liven up your sandwich.<br>
            Stop in to our local storefront in Madison, WI to enjoy a custom made bagel sandwich!</p>

        <h2>Bagel Care</h2>
        <p>Bagels Forever bagels, when defrosted, have a short but active life of four days because they contain no preservatives.
        To best deal with this slight eccentricity, your bagels must be kept in a well-secured plastic bag at all times to
        ensure their freshness. Store them in your refrigerator or freezer.</p>
        <p>Remember, if you take good care of your bagels, they will take good care of you.</p>
