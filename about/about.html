        <p>In 1973, Bagels Forever opened its retail bakery in Madison, Wisconsin, a big college town with a little bit of
        everything. Well, almost everything. Before us, the area lacked that bit of heaven known as New York-style bagels. We
        couldn't stand for that!</p>
        <p>Made from all-natural ingredients, boiled then hearth-baked, our bagels quickly earned their name as the real deal. Word
        got out, and today Bagels Forever bagels are sold in grocery stores throughout Wisconsin and the Midwest.</p>
        <p>The original bakery on University Avenue is still here. We're still making the authentic New York-style bagels people
        love. And four decades later, you can still get a fresh-from-the-hearth taste of our many varieties any day of the week!</p>
