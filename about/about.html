            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>In 1973, Bagels Forever opened its retail bakery in Madison, Wisconsin, a big college town with a little
                bit of
                everything. Well, almost everything. Before us, the area lacked that bit of heaven known as New
                York-style bagels. We
                couldn't stand for that!</p>
            <p>Made from all-natural ingredients, boiled then hearth-baked, our bagels quickly earned their name as the
                real deal. Word
                got out, and today Bagels Forever bagels are sold in grocery stores throughout Wisconsin and the
                Midwest.</p>
            <p>The original bakery on University Avenue is still here. We're still making the authentic New York-style
                bagels people
                love. And four decades later, you can still get a fresh-from-the-hearth taste of our many varieties any
                day of the week!</p>

            <h2>Bagel Care & Info</h2>
                        <p class="importance1">Remember, if you take good care of your bagels, they will take good care of you.</p>

            <h3>Bagel Preperation</h3>
            <p>Our bagel, even after it has been cut in half, is sometimes too large for the conventional toaster. In
                this instance,
                the bagel must be compressed after cutting in order to fit into the toaster slots.</p>

            <!-- <p>The bagel will make anything taste better. Consider using it in the construction of your next sandwich. A
                traditional
                favorite is composed of lox (smoked salmon) and cream cheese strategically placed between the two halves
                of a sliced
                bagel with a slice of tomato and onion to liven up your sandwich.<br>
                Stop in to our local storefront in Madison, WI to enjoy a custom made bagel sandwich!</p> -->
                
            <h3>Bagel Care</h3>
            <p>Bagels Forever bagels, when defrosted, have a short but active life of four days because they contain no
                preservatives.
                To best deal with this slight eccentricity, your bagels must be kept in a well-secured plastic bag at
                all times to
                ensure their freshness. Store them in your refrigerator or freezer.</p>
